# Teams

When you have formed a team and settled on a project idea, you'll need to add them to this page. **This is mandatory**. Only projects which have fully completed entries on this page will be judged (and therefore in the running for a prize). Teams can be between 1 and 6 people. Interdisciplinary teams are strongly encouraged.

**Deadlines**

* Teams must be finalised by 13:00 on Tuesday 17th Feb.
* Projects must have complete descriptions by 12:00 on Friday 20th Feb.

**How**

*You'll need a github account, but you can do all of the following through the Github interface, so no local git install or command line use required.* 

1. Fork [the respository for this website](https://github.com/ilwhack/ilwhack.github.io) on github
2. Update the teams section, found at `_posts/2014-01-07-teams.md` to add all the information about your team conforming to the template (which is markdown) specified below.
3. Submit a pull request (as described on [GitHub help](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)). If you're having trouble editing markdown and submitting a pull request, [file an issue](https://github.com/ilwhack/ilwhack.github.io/issues) which includes all the information specified in the template.

[**Screenshots of the process**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SYtJYotSCgou0bCyjRBv4av3byYJeOZ0XrVKhiZ-6QI/edit?usp=sharing)

#### CitySentiment

* https://github.com/theopavlakou/ilw2015

Takes Tweets from the area of Edinburgh to create a map of sentiment around the city. The final product is an interactive web app that provides a clean visualisation of the city's mood. Users can browse by date, or view the sentiment of live tweets in real time. CitySentiment uses sophisticated sentiment analysis techniques to ensure that the data on show is a meaningful snapshot of Edinburgh's Twitter users. The project could be extended to other cities, and could offer information such as the average sentiment for a user-defined location.

Themes: Data Visualisation, Communities and civic engagement

WhereNow is a website and application that allows you to find interesting locations to travel to based on social media trends. WhereNow keeps you up to date with what’s happening and where it’s happening and, most importantly, helps you get there fast! Based on the idea of discovery and spontaneous travel, WhereNow is the perfect way to plan your next fun adventure!

WhereNow uses a variety of data sources. We take location data generalised from Twitter where we look for areas around the world with anomalously high concentrations of tweets. Based on positive or negative sentiment from those tweets WhereNow converts this location into a trending “hotspot”. We then find the nearest airport to the event and use Simple Weather to tell you what the skies will look like when you get there, a short location descriptions is provided by Wikipedia, maps by Google, flight prices powered by Skyscanner, and photos via Panoramio.

Our goal was to visualize the data in a way that is informative and tells a story about various types of emerging technology trends in Nairobi. Beyond technology, it can also serve as a general platform to investigate other key development trends, such as gender or education, and even broader issues of society as well. We used data from local news media (Daily Nation), local reports (Voice of Kibera), technology blog (iHub) and Guardian website, and others can be easily incorporated.

Themes: Data Visualisation, International development, Communities and civic engagement

# Teams

When you have formed a team and settled on a project idea, you'll need to add them to this page. **This is mandatory**. Only projects which have fully completed entries on this page will be judged (and therefore in the running for a prize). Teams can be between 1 and 6 people. Interdisciplinary teams are strongly encouraged.

**Deadlines**

* Teams must be finalised by 13:00 on Tuesday 17th Feb.
* Projects must have complete descriptions by 12:00 on Friday 20th Feb.

**How**

*You'll need a github account, but you can do all of the following through the Github interface, so no local git install or command line use required.* 

1. Fork [the respository for this website](https://github.com/ilwhack/ilwhack.github.io) on github
2. Update the teams section, found at `_posts/2014-01-07-teams.md` to add all the information about your team conforming to the template (which is markdown) specified below.
3. Submit a pull request (as described on [GitHub help](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)). If you're having trouble editing markdown and submitting a pull request, [file an issue](https://github.com/ilwhack/ilwhack.github.io/issues) which includes all the information specified in the template.
